Example 2: Corona Virus Simulation 

This example models the time it takes for the corona virus to affect 100% of a population of 
1 Million people based on various behavioral rules. 
Documentation: see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3372334/

Techniques include:
1) Control, no changes in behaviors and habits of a population
2) Moderate, social distancing rules enacted
3) Significant, "shelter in place" policies passed
